## 🌱 What's Cooking?

I'm always experimenting and learning. Here are some projects I'm currently working on:

- **Network Security:** Develop a traffic analysis system that would function as an intrusion detection system, identifying data exfiltration attacks
- **Operating Systems:** I'm currently working on an assignment that focuses on implementing a version of the Netcat tool, which is used for redirecting text to different types of sockets.
- **System Programming:** An assignment that involves implementing the settlers of Catan board game for 3 players (in refernce to inheritence and OOP in C++).

## 🤝 Let's Connect
